# SlideDeck
if there are any overdue reminders, it will create a slidedeck. This will be a unique slidedeck with individual slides for this slidedeck
- these slideDecks will be on one page, listed in a table to view them
- This is the best feature for the application, so there will be navigation for this page
-  This slideDeck will take up the entire page with no navigation except 'Exit' that will go back to the slideDeck pages

# Slides
-  takes every overdue reminder and create a slide for that specific reminder
-  if there are multiple reminders for a memory, it will only look at one of the reminders for that memory
-  marks the reminder status as 'slide'
-  each reminder will have a link to the slideDeck
- each slide will have a layout for the memory
-  the reminders will not show on the memory anymore
